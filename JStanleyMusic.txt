 My father who was a singer and guitar player most of his life, gave me my first guitar at 12. While it was hard keeping up with him early on, perseverance kept me coming back to do better. Since then, my love of music has only grown, and I've held on to the gift of music my father nurtured in me. I enjoy playing for a crowd, having them sing along to a song they love and bringing back memories for them.
